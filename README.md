# DeepfakeFace 👁️‍🗨️

A machine learning project focused on detecting deepfake faces using image analysis and classification models.

## 📌 Project Overview

With the rise of synthetic media, particularly deepfakes, the ability to detect manipulated images and videos has become critical. This project uses deep learning techniques to analyze facial features and determine the authenticity of input face images.

## 🔍 Features

- Preprocessing of facial image data
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- Detection of deepfake vs real images
- Visualization of results
- Modular code structure for easy expansion

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (based on your implementation)
- OpenCV
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
